# Changelog

All notable changes to ArkLores will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added a GameData-only Fact-Check Agent with claim decomposition, directed support/counter-evidence searches, and conversation-aware follow-ups.
- Added supported, refuted, uncertain, and cannot-confirm verdict states with expandable GameData evidence.
- Added verdict enforcement that prevents supported/refuted results without retrieved GameData records.
- Added fact-check cancellation, retry, empty/error handling, localized UI strings, and narrow-screen text-scale coverage.

### Changed

- Updated shared Agent trust instructions so Wiki and user text are context only, never active GameData evidence.
- Replaced network-dependent Warfarin crawler output tests with deterministic offline parser and formatter contracts.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Switched v0.4.5 architecture to Chinese GameData release assets as the primary knowledge source.
- Reduced AI provider settings to Chat API only.
- Reworked local lore search around structured GameData tables, aliases, LIKE, and FTS.
- Paused user-imported materials indexing until the low-trust Book source path is redesigned.
- Added GameData DB install validation before replacing the installed knowledge base.
- Added structured retrieval QA tooling for fixed full-DB smoke queries and alias candidate checks.
- Improved Chinese intent normalization for voice, archive, operator record, module, enemy profile, and roguelike queries.
- Added GameData asset finalization metadata for compressed/uncompressed SHA-256 and byte sizes.
- Fixed `tools/setup.sh` parameter mode so remote GameData URL builds do not report stale temporary HTTP service state.

### Removed

- Removed built-in model assets, seed assets, and old seed builder scripts.
